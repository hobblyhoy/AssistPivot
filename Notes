event codes 
Note: line count is reported instead of request time. Reason being I was getting VERY drastic and inconsistant differences in request time for identical requests (up to 5x)
Also I used the params from report 18 since it's pretty complete. Other reports that didn't come in (designated by "--") may very well just not have the correct set of params tied to them
