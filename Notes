Note: line count is reported instead of request time. Reason being I was getting VERY drastic and inconsistant differences in request time for identical requests (up to 5x)
Also I used the params from report 18 since it's pretty complete. Other reports that didn't come in (designated by "--") may very well just not have the correct set of params tied to them

Recompared our most promising reports, 18 and 12 with different colleges. While the 12 report certainly is formatted more straight foreward it raises just as many parsing difficulties as the 18 report. 18 is also currently in use on assist so less likely to removed any time soon and contains less lines. For that reason I'm going to keep it to report 18.
