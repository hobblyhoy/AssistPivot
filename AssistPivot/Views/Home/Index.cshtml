    <h1>Assist Pivot</h1>
    <p class="lead">Assist Pivot is a tool for analyzing course equivalences from the point of view of particular college course rather than college to college</p>
    <h2>But why tho</h2>
    <p>For the situations where you need a particular course to transfer or complete along side your existing coursework and you dont care where you complete it. This is particularly true for classes you intend to take online.</p>
    <p>Requests may happen immediately or may be up to a week old because we like assist and dont want to accidentally ddos them.</p>
    <p>Truthfully I'm mostly makeing this because I (your humble page developer) wanted to learn how to scrape / parse html pages, how to manage atypical data relationships, and cache management from the ground up.</p>
